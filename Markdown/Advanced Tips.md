# Advanced Tips by Martin Adams


You can embed an entire note with an !
` ![[embednoteslikethis]] ` 

using the ^ within a note creates a reference the line above it, allowing you to select specific references when linking to a note. ``` [[Note^reference]]``` This can be specified but is also auto-generated.

This can be paired with ! and # to specifiy headers and preview the reference section under a specific heading.
