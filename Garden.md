# Garden
This is my Garden, my personal wikipidia of notes, ideas, and work. An obsidian document shared with the world. The goal is automating my workflow, from the conceptual idea to published content.

This is a test, github is limited to sub-100 files, which my Master Vault exceeds.
TODO - [[A Complete Guide on How to Automate Obsidian to Online Publication]]
I realize Obsidian offers a publication service, but in my Computer Science journy, my goal is to work with as few dependancies as possible.

Markdown is easy enough, I'm interested in the [[Markdown to HTML & CSS]] conversion, it's limitations and dependencies.
